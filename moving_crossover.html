  <br><br><h1>Moving Average Crossover</h1><hr>
  <p>Moving averages are ideally one of the most popular indicators used by traders for technical analysis but there is a limitation that the moving average is a lagging indicator. This is the reason why traders do not completely rely on moving averages and generally wait for the crossovers which is the strongest possible signal they generate.<br><br>
  A crossover occurs when a short term moving average crosses either above a long term moving average which is known as <i>bullish crossover</i> or below which is considered as a <i>bearish crossover.</i>
  <ul>
     <li>A moving average crossover occurs when the two moving averages one with a shorter period and other with a longer period cross each other.</li>
     <li>As moving averages are lagging indicator, crossover technique may not capture exact tops and bottoms. But it helps trader to identify the trend and it does not predict future direction.</li>
     <li>This strategy is used to identify shifts in momentum  and to determine entry/exit strategy.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <h2>Types of Moving Average Crossover</h2><hr>
  <p> Moving averages are used not only to provide Support and Resistance levels but also indicates potential turning points around the crossovers.
      There are two groups of moving averages used for crossovers:
      <ul>
         <li>Long term moving averages</li>
         <li>Short term moving average</li>
      </ul>
     <h3>Long term moving averages</h3>
     Long term moving averages (50 day, 100 day, 200 day) are referred to as slow moving averages. As longer moving average take more number of data points to calculate the average and therefore, it tends to stay away from current market price. Hence, the reaction is slower. Due to this slow nature of these moving averages, there is a risk that the signals produced can be relatively lagging if compared with short term moving averages.<br><br>
     <h3>Short term moving averages</h3>
     Short term moving averages (10 day, 20 day, 30 day) are referred to as fast moving averages. The short moving average reacts more quickly because it takes less number of data points and therefore, it tends to stick more close to current market price. It produces much more signals that can be timelier than the long term moving averages due to the reactive nature of these moving averages. However, there can be large number of false signals because of its reactive movement and more signals.<br><br>
	 <p>Long term moving average crossover can often be labelled "Golden cross" and "Death cross" depending on whether they have bullish or bearish trend. Let's understand the types of moving average crossover.</p>
	 
  <ol>
     <li>Golden Cross</li>
     <li>Death Cross</li>
  </ol><br>
  <h3>Golden Cross</h3>
  <p>Golden cross is formed from a crossover which involves a stock's/security's medium term moving average(50 day) breaking above its long term moving average(200 day). It indicates a BULL market and it reflects a major shift in market sentiments as bulls prevail over bears.<br>
  There are three stages of Golden cross.</p><br>
  <ol>
     <li>Firstly, there is a down-trend prior to the crossing of the moving averages. As and when the down-trend in the stock markets ends, the short term moving average(50 day SMA) moves below the long term moving average(200 day SMA).</li>
     <li>In second stage, the short term moving average crosses long term moving average and crossover/intersection happens and a new trend emerges out.</li>
     <li>In the last stage, there need to be continuation where short term moving average continues to move upward and 50 day MA or 200 day MA act as Support for prices to reach higher levels. It also signifies the Bullish trend.</li>
  </ol><br>
  <img src="..\static\images\death-cross-golden-cross.png" style="width:700px;"\><br><br>
  <h3>Death Cross</h3>
  <p>Death cross is exact opposite of golden cross and it is formed when a stock's medium term moving average (50 day) breaking below its long term moving average(200 day). It indicates the potential of major sell off i.e. a signal for bear turn in the market and has proven to be an excellent predictor of most severe BEAR markets of the past century.<br>
  The death cross name comes from the X-shape which is created when short moving average goes below the long moving average.
  There are three stages of Death cross.</p><br>
  <ol>
     <li>Firstly, there is an uptrend prior to the crossing of the moving averages and when this uptrend ends, the short term moving average(50 day SMA) moves above the long term moving average(200 day SMA).</li>
	 <li>In the second stage, the crossover formed when short term moving average crosses long term moving average and new trend emerges out which indicates the beginning of death cross.</li>
	 <li>Finally, there need to be continuation where short term moving average continues to move downward and and 50 day MA or 200 day MA act as Resistance for prices and will force it to reach down lower levels. It signals the Bearish trend.</li>
  </ol><br><br>
  <h2> Trading with Moving Crossover</h2><hr>
  <p>Moving average crossover strategy is the modified system of basic Moving average strategy and it helps to smooth out the entry/exit points for trade. Although the trader gets fewer signal but the chances of trade being profitable are quite high.<br><br>
  <b>Buy on cross up</b><br>
  There is an opportunity to Buy a stock if the short term moving average turns greater than the long term moving average. You can stay in this trade as long as this condition is satisfied and there is no emerging new trend.</p>
  <p><b>Sell on cross down</b><br>
  Sell-off/Exit the long position when the short term moving average turns lesser than the long term moving average.</p><br>
  <p><i>Sometimes price of a stock may swing back and forth and moving averages gets "tangled up" for some period of time and generates multiple losing trades which is known as whipsaws. Whenever this happens, it is advisable to stay aside or choose another indicator to clarify the exact trend or whipsaws can be reduced by adding an additional moving average to create a triple moving average crossover system. </i></p><br><br>
