     <br><br><h1>Moving Average Convergence Divergence(MACD)</h1><hr>
     <p>Moving average convergence divergence indicator is a momentum oscillator developed by Gerald Appel in the late seventies. It is a trend following indicator which is based on the relationship between two moving averages of prices.<br>
	 The MACD measures the convergence, or divergence, between short term moving average and long term moving average. Convergence occurs when two moving averages move towards each other, and Divergence occurs when the moving averages moves away from each other.<br><br>
	 <ul>
	 <li>MACD is trend following as well as momentum indicator. So, it measures both trend and momentum, where momentum shows the strength of the trend.</li>
	 <li>MACD oscillates above and below zero line as moving averages converge, diverge, or cross each other. This is how it generates signals for Buy or Sell.</li>
	 </ul><br></p>
     <h2>Interpretation</h2><hr>
	 MACD indicator consist of three components:
	 <ul>
	    <li>MACD Line - it measures the distance between two moving averages </li>
		<li>The Signal line - it identifies the change in price momentum and generates Buy/Sell signals.</li>
		<li>The Histogram - it represents the difference between the MACD line and the Signal line.</li>
	</ul><br>

	<b> MACD Line</b><br>
     The MACD is the difference between two exponential moving averages and both the EMA's are based on the closing prices. Exponential moving average is a type of moving average that places a greater weight and significance on the recent data points. It is calculated by subtracting the 26-day exponential moving average(EMA) from the 12-day EMA, to estimate the Convergence and Divergence(CD) value. <br><br>
	 MACD uses moving averages, which we know are lagging indicators which are in turn, converted into a momentum oscillator by subtracting the long term moving average from the short term moving average. The resulting chart forms a line that oscillates above and below zero, without any upper or lower boundaries:
	 <ul>
	     <li>If MACD is greater than zero, it means that the short term average is greater than the long term average and hence signalling an uptrend.</li>
	     <li>On the contrary, if MACD is less than zero then it indicates a down trend.</li>
	</ul><br>
	<img src="..\static\images\macd_chart.png" alt="macd chart"/><br><br>
	 <b> The Signal Line</b><br>
	 A 9-day EMA of the MACD, called the signal line/trigger line and is often plotted on top of the MACD, and it functions as a trigger for buy and sell signals.<br><br>
	 <b>The Histogram</b><br>
	 The histogram is the graphical representation of the distance between the two lines. If the MACD crosses through the signal line from below then trader could use it as a Buy signal, and if it crosses through the signal line from above then trader might use it as a Sell signal.
	 MACD histogram offers a deeper insight into the balance of power between the bulls and bears than does the MACD.<br>
	 <br>
	 <i>The values of 12-day,26-day and 9-day are ideally used with the MACD, but other values can be substituted depending on the trading style and goals.</i><br><br>
	 <h2>Trading with MACD </h2><hr>
	 <p>The MACD is best applied in trending markets. There are three ways of using the MACD:<br>
     <ol>
         <li>MACD crossover/Center line crossovers/Bullish or Bearish moving average</li>
         <li>Overbought/oversold</li>
         <li>Positive/negative divergences</li>
     </ol>
     <b>MACD Crossover</b><br>
	 A crossover occurs when MACD line moves above or below the zero point, or when the MACD line goes above its 9-day EMA, i.e the signal line.<br>
	 <ul>
	     <li> There is a signal to buy when MACD crosses over above the signal/trigger line, and sell when it falls below the signal line. This crossover signal is quite common but its not to be relied upon just because of the crossover. Trader should apply this strategy in combination with some other technical analysis tools in order to avoid getting whipsawed.</li>
         <li>Center line crossover occurs when MACD moves above, or below the zero line and into positive or negative territory and thus Buy/Sell signals are generated. It indicates the change in momentum either from bullish to bearish, or from bearish to bullish.</li>
     </ul><br>
     <b>Overbought/oversold</b><br>
     MACD is not useful as an overbought/oversold indicator. Overbought/oversold means prices have moved too far and fast whether up or down, and a consolidation or correction is likely to occur. The general rule is, you sell when price oscillators reach overbought and you buy when oscillators reach oversold.<br><br>
	 As an oscillator fluctuates above and below a center line, or between set levels, as its value changes over time. Oscillators can remain at extreme levels(overbought/oversold) for extended periods, but they can not trend for sustained period.<br><br>
     <ul>
         <li> When a stock is in strong up trend, buying in oversold conditions work much better than selling in overbought conditions. It is because in a strong up/down trend the MACD may remain at overbought/oversold for an extended period of time and price will keep on rising/falling.</li>
		 <li>Likewise, during a strong down trend, selling in overbought conditions work much better than buying in oversold conditions.</li>
	</ul>
	<i>However, MACD is not a reliable indicator for identifying overbought/oversold levels, as it does not have any upper/lower limits or boundaries to restrict its movements.</i><br><br>
    <b>Positive/negative divergences</b><br>	
	 Divergence occurs when the prices are rising/falling but momentum is not going up/down along with the price.<br>
	 There are two types of divergences:<br><br>
	 <ol>
	     <li><b>Positive divergence</b> - it occurs when the momentum indicator goes up but price moves down.</li>
	     <li><b>Negative divergence</b> - it occurs when a momentum indicator goes down but the price moves up.</li>
	 </ol>
	 Divergence is the key concept behind many signals for oscillators. Divergence serves as a warning that a trend is about to change. But definitely, trend reversal signals should be confirmed with the price action.<br><br>
	 <i>MACD encompasses both momentum and trend and so can be considered as a trend following indicator. The use of exponential moving averages ensures that some of the lag is eliminated but essentially it remains a lagging indicator. This problem can be partly eliminated by the use of the MACD Histogram.</i></p><br>
